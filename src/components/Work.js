                                From 2021 to 2023, I was a web designer and developer 
                                for Bergdorf Goodman's email campaigns. I was responsible for incorporating 
                                rich text into email files, coding over 20 email template designs with 
                                HTML and CSS, designing layouts for various email-exclusive editorials, 
                                and creating graphic designs that have been featured across email,&nbsp;

                                and <a href="https://instagram.com/bergdorfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bergdorfs</a>.

                            <p>
                                As a developer, I followed current email standards and code practices to ensure that 
                                email HTML was both mobile-optimized and consistent across email platforms.
                            </p>
                                <br/>
                            <p>
                                As a designer, I made sure that layouts were consistent from email to email, 
                                optimized for the user, and aligned with Bergdorfâ€™s digital brand.
                            </p>
